# First Repository

This is my very first repository with the Kekambas-125 cohort!


### Git Commands
1. `git init`
2. `git add <file>` OR `git add .`
3. `git commit -m "Your message"`
4. `git add REMOTE_NAME REMOTE_URL` *remote name will usually be `origin`
5. `git push REMOTE_NAME BRANCH_NAME`


### Git Clone
To clone a remote repository locally, navigate to the directory in which you would like to add the new folder. the git clone commmand will create a child directory in that folder.
`git clone URL_FOR_REMOTE_REPO <new_folder_name>`
* new folder name is optional, default is remote repo name
